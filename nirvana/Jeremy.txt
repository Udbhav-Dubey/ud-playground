t home drawing pictures of mountain tops
With him on top, lemon-yellow sun
Arms raised in a V
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below
Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Clearly I remember pickin' on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck, ooh
But we unleashed the lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast, how can I forget?
And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurting, ooh, dropped wide open
Just like the day
Oh, like the day I heard
Daddy didn't give affection, no
And the boy was something that Mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Try to forget this (try to forget this)
Try to erase this (try to erase this)
From the blackboard
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in, Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (spoke in, spoke in)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (spoke in, spoke in)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (spoke in)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (spoke in, ah))
Whoa-oh, oh-oh
(Spoke in, spoke in)
Whoa-oh, oh-oh (spoke in)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (spoke in)
Whoa-oh (spoke in, spoke in)
Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, yeah
Ah-ah (spoke in), ah-ah (spoke in)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah
Ah-ah (spoke in), ah-ah (spoke in)
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
