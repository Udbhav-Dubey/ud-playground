What else should I be?
All apologies
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay
What else could I write?
I don't have the right
What else should I be?
All apologies
In the sun
In the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried
I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn freezer burn
Choking on the ashes of her enemy
In the sun
In the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, married
Married, buried
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
All in all is all we all are
